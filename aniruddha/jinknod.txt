Certainly! Based on the Jenkinsfile from the provided repository, here's a similar Jenkinsfile tailored for a Node.js application:

groovy
Copy
Edit
pipeline {
    agent any

    tools {
        nodejs 'NodeJS_16' // Ensure this matches your configured Node.js version in Jenkins
    }

    environment {
        // Define any environment variables here
        NODE_ENV = 'production'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                echo 'Cloning repository...'
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/your-username/your-nodejs-repo.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                echo 'Installing dependencies...'
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }

        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
                sh 'npm test'
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building application...'
                sh 'npm run build'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying application...'
                // Add your deployment commands here, e.g., copying files, restarting services, etc.
                // Example:
                // sh 'scp -r ./dist user@your-server:/path/to/deploy'
                // sh 'ssh user@your-server "pm2 restart your-app"'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline executed successfully.'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline failed.'
        }
    }
}
Notes:

Node.js Configuration: Ensure that the Node.js version specified (NodeJS_16 in this example) is configured in Jenkins under Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration. If not already set up, you can install the NodeJS plugin and define the desired Node.js version there.

Repository URL: Replace 'https://github.com/your-username/your-nodejs-repo.git' with the URL of your Node.js application's Git repository.

Deployment Steps: The Deploy stage is a placeholder. You'll need to add the actual commands to deploy your application, which might include copying build artifacts to a server, restarting services, or other deployment-related tasks.

Environment Variables: Define any necessary environment variables in the environment block to be used across stages.

This Jenkinsfile sets up a continuous integration pipeline that checks out your code, installs dependencies, runs tests, builds the application, and then deploys it. Adjust the stages and steps as needed to fit the specific requirements of your Node.js application.

Here's a sample Jenkins pipeline (Jenkinsfile) for a Python application that uses pytest for testing and coverage.py for generating a code coverage report:

                    reportFiles: 'index.html',
                    reportName: 'HTML Code Coverage'
                ])
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline completed successfully.'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline failed.'
        }
    }
}
ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites
âœ… Jenkins must have the following plugins:

ShiningPanda (optional but helpful for Python virtualenvs)

HTML Publisher Plugin

âœ… Your requirements.txt should include pytest and coverage, or the script can install them dynamically (as above).

âœ… Structure:

Copy
Edit
your-python-repo/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ Jenkinsfile
âœ… Output
After the test stage, an HTML coverage report is created in the htmlcov/ directory.

Jenkins will archive and display the HTML report under "HTML Code Coverage" in the build summary.

Would you like me to generate a requirements.txt or example test file too?
