Here's a code-based walkthrough to help you comprehend the main topics from your Python for DevOps syllabus. Each section includes code snippets with short explanations:

📁 1. Automating Files & Filesystem (os, os.path, os.walk)
import os

# Create a directory
os.makedirs("devops_logs/errors", exist_ok=True)

# List files in a directory
print("Files in current dir:", os.listdir('.'))

# Walk through a directory
for root, dirs, files in os.walk("devops_logs"):
    for name in files:
        print(os.path.join(root, name))
📂 2. Managing Files/Directories
# Create and write to a file
with open("devops_logs/info.log", "w") as f:
    f.write("DevOps log started\n")

# Rename a file
os.rename("devops_logs/info.log", "devops_logs/main.log")

# Delete a file
os.remove("devops_logs/main.log")
🔍 3. Regular Expressions for Text Search
import re

log_text = "Error: Disk full at 10:32AM"
if re.search(r"Error.*\d{2}:\d{2}[AP]M", log_text):
    print("An error with timestamp found.")
📚 4. Handling Large Files (read line by line)
def read_large_file(filepath):
    with open(filepath, "r") as f:
        for line in f:
            if "ERROR" in line:
                print(line.strip())

# read_large_file("path_to_large_log_file.log")
🔐 5. Hashing with hashlib
import hashlib

data = "important_data"
hashed = hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()
print("SHA256 Hash:", hashed)
🔏 6. Encryption with cryptography
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher = Fernet(key)

encrypted = cipher.encrypt(b"secret config")
print("Encrypted:", encrypted)
print("Decrypted:", cipher.decrypt(encrypted))
🧰 7. Introduction to Popular Libraries
pandas
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({"Server": ["A", "B"], "Load": [0.5, 0.8]})
print(df)
requests
import requests
r = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/get")
print(r.json())
selenium (basic example, requires setup)
from selenium import webdriver
driver = webdriver.Firefox()  # or Chrome()
driver.get("https://example.com")
print(driver.title)
driver.quit()
scapy
from scapy.all import IP, ICMP, sr1

packet = IP(dst="8.8.8.8")/ICMP()
response = sr1(packet, timeout=2, verbose=0)
if response:
    print("Ping success")
🌱 8. Python Virtual Environments
python -m venv venv_devops
source venv_devops/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv_devops\Scripts\activate
🧺 9. Python Collections
lst = [1, 2, 3]
tup = (1, 2, 3)
st = {1, 2, 2, 3}

print("List:", lst)
print("Tuple:", tup)
print("Set:", st)
🧪 10. Unit Testing & Mocking
unittest
import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class TestAdd(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)

# Run with: python -m unittest filename.py
pytest with fixture and mock
# test_file.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

how read csv files using pandas
ChatGPT said:
Reading CSV files using pandas is simple and powerful. Here's a basic guide with examples:

✅ Basic CSV Reading
import pandas as pd

# Read a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Display the first 5 rows
print(df.head())
📌 Common Parameters
# Custom delimiter (e.g., tab-separated file)
df = pd.read_csv("data.tsv", delimiter="\t")

# No header in CSV
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv", header=None)

# Rename columns manually
df.columns = ["Name", "Age", "City"]

# Read specific columns
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv", usecols=["Name", "City"])

# Skip first 2 rows (useful for metadata in top rows)
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv", skiprows=2)

# Handle missing values
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv", na_values=["NA", "n/a", "missing"])
🔄 Preview & Inspect
print(df.info())         # Data types and nulls
print(df.describe())     # Stats for numeric columns
print(df.columns)        # Column names
print(df.shape)          # Rows and columns count
📁 Example CSV Content (data.csv)
Name,Age,City
Alice,30,New York
Bob,25,Los Angeles
Charlie,35,Chicago
Let me know if you'd like to filter, clean, or visualize CSV data too.

You said:
pandas is used for csv files only?
ChatGPT said:
Great question! No, Pandas is not limited to CSV files. It's a powerful data analysis and manipulation library that supports many data formats and operations.

✅ Pandas Can Read From & Write To:
📄 Flat Files
CSV: read_csv(), to_csv()

TSV: read_csv(delimiter='\t')

TXT: read_table()

📊 Excel Files
df = pd.read_excel("data.xlsx", sheet_name="Sheet1")
df.to_excel("output.xlsx")
🗃️ JSON Files
df = pd.read_json("data.json")
df.to_json("output.json")
🗂️ SQL Databases
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("mydb.sqlite")
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM users", conn)
🌐 Web Data (HTML Tables)
tables = pd.read_html("https://example.com/table-page")
print(tables[0])  # First table on the page
🧪 Other Formats
Parquet: read_parquet(), to_parquet()

HDF5: read_hdf()

ORC: read_orc()

Feather: read_feather()

🔧 Key Use Cases of Pandas (Beyond Reading Files):
Cleaning and transforming data

Filtering, grouping, and aggregating

Handling missing values

Merging and joining datasets

Time series analysis

Data visualization (with help from matplotlib/seaborn)

Let me know what type of data you're working with—I can show an example with that format!

You said:
teach basic pandas fnctions
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here's a clear breakdown of basic Pandas functions every beginner should know, with examples to help you understand how they work:

🔹 1. Importing Pandas
import pandas as pd
🔹 2. Creating a DataFrame
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
🔹 3. Viewing Data
df.head()        # First 5 rows
df.tail()        # Last 5 rows
df.sample(2)     # Random 2 rows
🔹 4. Getting Info
df.shape         # (rows, columns)
df.columns       # List of column names
df.dtypes        # Data types
df.info()        # Summary of DataFrame
df.describe()    # Summary stats for numeric columns
🔹 5. Selecting Data
df['Name']              # Single column
df[['Name', 'City']]    # Multiple columns
df.iloc[0]              # Row by index (0-based)
df.loc[0, 'Name']       # Specific value
df[df['Age'] > 28]      # Filtering
🔹 6. Modifying Data
df['Age'] = df['Age'] + 1              # Modify a column
df['Country'] = 'USA'                  # Add new column
df.loc[1, 'City'] = 'San Francisco'    # Update a value
🔹 7. Sorting & Ranking
df.sort_values('Age')                      # Ascending
df.sort_values('Age', ascending=False)     # Descending
df.sort_values(['City', 'Age'])            # Sort by multiple columns
🔹 8. Handling Missing Data
df.isnull()              # Check for NaNs
df.dropna()              # Drop rows with NaNs
df.fillna('Unknown')     # Replace NaNs
🔹 9. Group and Aggregate
df.groupby('City')['Age'].mean()      # Average age per city
df.groupby('City').agg({'Age': ['min', 'max']})
🔹 10. Exporting Data
df.to_csv("output.csv", index=False)
df.to_excel("output.xlsx")
Want a mini project using these functions? I can guide you through analyzing a sample dataset like sales, employees, or log data.

Use the os module to list all files in a directory and display their sizes.
Implement a regular expression to search for email addresses in a text file.
Create a program that reads a large CSV file and processes its data.Solve 3 ques 
ChatGPT said:
Here's a Python script that solves all three problems you mentioned using the os module, re for regular expressions, and pandas for large CSV processing.

✅ 1. List all files in a directory and display their sizes
import os

def list_files_with_size(directory):
    print(f"Files in '{directory}':")
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        path = os.path.join(directory, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(path):
            size = os.path.getsize(path)
            print(f"{filename} - {size} bytes")

# Example usage
list_files_with_size(".")  # Use any directory path
✅ 2. Search for email addresses in a text file using regular expressions
import re

def extract_emails(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        text = f.read()

    emails = re.findall(r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}', text)
    print("Email addresses found:")
    for email in emails:
        print(email)

# Example usage
# extract_emails("sample.txt")
✅ 3. Read a large CSV file and process its data
import pandas as pd

def process_large_csv(file_path):
    chunk_size = 10000
    total_rows = 0

    for chunk in pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=chunk_size):
        total_rows += len(chunk)
        print(f"Processed chunk with {len(chunk)} rows")

    print(f"Total rows processed: {total_rows}")

# Example usage
# process_large_csv("large_file.csv")
🧪 Example Files to Test With
sample.txt → Text file with some email addresses.

large_file.csv → A large CSV with many rows.

A folder containing files to test the first function.

Let me know if you'd like these combined into a single CLI app, or want to add logging, filtering, or performance tracking!

You said:
what does read_csv returns
ChatGPT said:
The pandas.read_csv() function returns a DataFrame object, which is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure (like a table with rows and columns).

✅ Example
Given a file data.csv:

Name,Age,City
Alice,25,New York
Bob,30,Los Angeles
Charlie,35,Chicago
Code:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(type(df))
print(df)
✅ Output:
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
      Name  Age         City
0    Alice   25     New York
1      Bob   30  Los Angeles
2  Charlie   35      Chicago
📌 Key Properties of the Returned DataFrame
Rows are indexed by default as 0, 1, 2, ...

Columns are inferred from the first line (unless otherwise specified)

Supports slicing, filtering, transformation, etc.

Example: Accessing Data
df['Name']         # Column access
df.loc[0]          # First row
df.iloc[1, 2]      # Cell at 2nd row, 3rd column (City of Bob)
Let me know if you want to learn how to write this DataFrame back to a file or manipulate it in specific ways!

You said:
parse a file and find the error and time stamp from it and store it in json format
ChatGPT said:
Here's a Python script that parses a log file, extracts error messages and their timestamps, and stores them in JSON format.

✅ Example Log File (logfile.txt)
[2025-05-25 14:35:22] INFO Starting process
[2025-05-25 14:36:01] ERROR Failed to connect to database
[2025-05-25 14:36:45] WARNING Disk space low
[2025-05-25 14:37:12] ERROR Timeout occurred during backup
✅ Python Script
import re
import json

def extract_errors_to_json(log_path, output_json):
    error_list = []

    with open(log_path, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            match = re.search(r'\[(.*?)\]\s+ERROR\s+(.*)', line)
            if match:
                timestamp = match.group(1)
                error_message = match.group(2)
                error_list.append({
                    "timestamp": timestamp,
                    "error": error_message
                })

    # Save to JSON file
    with open(output_json, 'w') as out:
        json.dump(error_list, out, indent=4)

    print(f"{len(error_list)} error(s) written to {output_json}")

# Example usage
# extract_errors_to_json("logfile.txt", "errors.json")
✅ Output JSON (errors.json)
[
    {
        "timestamp": "2025-05-25 14:36:01",
        "error": "Failed to connect to database"
    },
    {
        "timestamp": "2025-05-25 14:37:12",
        "error": "Timeout occurred during backup"
    }
]
Let me know if you want to enhance this to include log levels, or convert it into a CLI or API utility!

You said:
match = re.search(r'\[(.*?)\]\s+ERROR\s+(.*)', line) what means
ChatGPT said:
Great question! Let's break down this line of code:

match = re.search(r'\[(.*?)\]\s+ERROR\s+(.*)', line)
This uses regular expressions to extract specific parts of a log line — namely the timestamp and the error message.

🔍 What the Pattern Means
\[       # Match a literal '[' (square bracket)
(.*?)    # Match any characters (non-greedy), and capture them → this is the timestamp
\]       # Match a literal ']'

\s+      # Match one or more whitespace characters

ERROR    # Match the literal word "ERROR"

\s+      # Match one or more whitespace characters

(.*)     # Match and capture everything after "ERROR" → this is the error message
🎯 Example Matched Line:
[2025-05-25 14:36:01] ERROR Failed to connect to database
📦 Captured Groups:
match.group(1) → "2025-05-25 14:36:01" (timestamp)

match.group(2) → "Failed to connect to database" (error message)

✅ How re.search() Works
It searches only the first match in the line.

If it finds a match, it returns a match object.

If it doesn't, it returns None.

Let me know if you'd like help creating or debugging your own regular expressions — I'm happy to assist!

You said:
\\s

s means whitespace
ChatGPT said:
Yes, exactly!

In regular expressions, \s means a whitespace character.

✅ \s matches:
Space (' ')

Tab (\t)

Newline (\n)

Carriage return (\r)

Form feed (\f)

Vertical tab (\v)

📌 Common Regex Shorthand
Pattern	Meaning
\s	Any whitespace character
\S	Any non-whitespace character
\d	Any digit (0–9)
\D	Any non-digit character
\w	Any word character (a-zA-Z0-9_)
\W	Any non-word character
So in your regex:

\s+
This means: match one or more whitespace characters.

json.dump?explain
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Let's break down what json.dump() does in Python.

🧩 json.dump(): What It Does
json.dump() is a function from Python’s built-in json module that writes a Python object to a JSON file.

✅ Basic Syntax
import json

json.dump(obj, file, indent=4)
🔹 Parameters:
Parameter	Description
obj	The Python object to convert (usually dict or list)
file	A file-like object (opened with write mode)
indent	(Optional) Makes the output pretty-printed (human-readable)
✅ Example
import json

data = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "skills": ["Python", "DevOps", "Docker"]
}

with open("data.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=4)
📄 Output in data.json:
{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "skills": [
        "Python",
        "DevOps",
        "Docker"
    ]
}
🔄 Related Functions
json.load(f) → Read JSON from a file

json.dumps(obj) → Convert Python object to JSON string

json.loads(s) → Parse JSON string into Python object

Let me know if you'd like to try a hands-on practice using json.dump()!

You said:
re functions like search,match ,find plz explain few
ChatGPT said:
Sure! Let's explore some of the most commonly used Python re module functions with simple explanations and examples:

🔹 1. re.search(pattern, string)
Searches for the first match of the pattern anywhere in the string.

Returns a match object or None.

✅ Example:
import re

text = "Error at line 42"
match = re.search(r'\d+', text)

if match:
    print(match.group())  # Output: 42
🔹 2. re.match(pattern, string)
Matches only at the beginning of the string.

Returns a match object or None.

✅ Example:
text = "Error at line 42"
match = re.match(r'Error', text)

if match:
    print(match.group())  # Output: Error
❗Note: If the text was "Line 42 has an error", re.match(r'Error', text) would return None because "Error" is not at the start.

🔹 3. re.findall(pattern, string)
Returns a list of all matches of the pattern in the string.

✅ Example:
text = "Contact: john@example.com, alice@site.org"
emails = re.findall(r'\b[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.\w+\b', text)

print(emails)  # Output: ['john@example.com', 'alice@site.org']
🔹 4. re.finditer(pattern, string)
Like findall(), but returns an iterator of match objects, which is useful if you're processing large data or need match positions.

✅ Example:
text = "User IDs: 101, 202, 303"
for match in re.finditer(r'\d+', text):
    print(match.group(), "at", match.start())
🔹 5. re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)
Substitutes all occurrences of the pattern with a replacement.

✅ Example:
text = "price is $100"
new_text = re.sub(r'\$\d+', '$0', text)

print(new_text)  # Output: price is $0
✍️ Summary Table
Function	Purpose	Returns
search()	First match anywhere in string	Match object / None
match()	Match at start of string	Match object / None
findall()	All matches	List of matches
finditer()	All matches (iterator)	Iterator of Match objects
sub()	Replace matches	New string

r'[a-zA-Z0-9./#?]+\@+[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.+[a-z][2]' is this is regex to find emails ,correct me if iam wrong
ChatGPT said:
You're close, but that regex pattern has a few issues that may prevent it from accurately and consistently matching email addresses. Let’s analyze your pattern first and then provide a corrected version.

🔍 Your Regex:
[a-zA-Z0-9./#?]+\@+[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.+[a-z][2]
❌ Issues:
\@+ – the + is not needed after @; there should only be one @.

[a-z][2] – this does not mean “2-letter domain”; it's interpreted as: match a lowercase letter (a to z), followed by the literal character 2.

[#?/]+ – characters like /, #, and ? are not valid in the local part of most emails.

\. – you’re escaping the dot correctly, but the surrounding structure isn’t robust.

✅ Correct Regex for Basic Email Match:
r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}'
📌 Explanation:
Component	Meaning
[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+	Matches the username part
@	Literal at symbol
[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+	Matches the domain name
\.	Literal dot
[a-zA-Z]{2,}	Domain suffix (e.g., com, org, io, etc.)
✅ Example in Code:
import re

text = "Please email us at contact@example.com or support@service.org"
emails = re.findall(r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}', text)

print(emails)  # Output: ['contact@example.com', 'support@service.org']
Would you like a version that also checks for edge cases (e.g., subdomains, quoted usernames)?

You said:
new\_text = re.sub(r'\\$\\d+', '$0', text)

why + after d
ChatGPT said:
Great question!

You're referring to this regex from the earlier example:

re.sub(r'\$\d+', '$0', text)
Let’s break down specifically why \d+ is used.

🔍 What \d+ Means
\d → matches a single digit (0 to 9)

+ → means "one or more" of the preceding token (in this case, digits)

So:

\d+   ➜ matches numbers like 1, 42, 100, 123456
🔍 Full Pattern: \$\d+
\$ → matches the literal dollar sign $

\d+ → matches one or more digits

So \$\d+ will match:

$5

$100

$9999

etc.

🧪 Example
import re

text = "Original price was $100, now it's $0!"
new_text = re.sub(r'\$\d+', '$0', text)
print(new_text)  # Replaces all prices with "$0"
Let me know if you'd like to try creating custom patterns for ₹, €, %, etc., or use regex to extract prices and convert currencies!

You said:
show more such
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here are more practical regex examples using \d+, \w+, \s+, and others — all with real-world use cases you’ll often encounter in DevOps, logs, automation, and data cleaning.

✅ 1. Extract All Numbers from Text
import re

text = "Disk 1 has 500GB, Disk 2 has 1000GB"
numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', text)

print(numbers)  # ['1', '500', '2', '1000']
✅ 2. Extract Words
text = "DevOps tools: Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes"
words = re.findall(r'\w+', text)

print(words)  # ['DevOps', 'tools', 'Docker', 'Jenkins', 'Kubernetes']
\w → matches letters, numbers, and underscore ([a-zA-Z0-9_])

+ → one or more

✅ 3. Find IP Addresses
log = "Ping 192.168.1.1 successful, but 10.0.0.256 failed"
ips = re.findall(r'\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b', log)

print(ips)  # ['192.168.1.1', '10.0.0.256']
✅ 4. Extract Dates in YYYY-MM-DD Format
text = "Server restarted on 2025-05-25 and again on 2025-06-01"
dates = re.findall(r'\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}', text)

print(dates)  # ['2025-05-25', '2025-06-01']
✅ 5. Validate Simple Email Addresses
text = "Send to admin@domain.com or root@host.net"
emails = re.findall(r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}', text)

print(emails)  # ['admin@domain.com', 'root@host.net']
✅ 6. Find Error Logs from Log Text
log = """
[INFO] Starting service
[ERROR] Connection failed
[WARNING] Low memory
[ERROR] Disk full
"""

errors = re.findall(r'\[ERROR\]\s+(.*)', log)
print(errors)  # ['Connection failed', 'Disk full']
✅ 7. Substitute Numbers in Text
text = "Build version 1234 released"
cleaned = re.sub(r'\d+', 'XXXX', text)

print(cleaned)  # 'Build version XXXX released'
✅ 8. Remove Extra Whitespace
text = "Too     much    space"
cleaned = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)

print(cleaned)  # 'Too much space'
Want me to show patterns for file paths, URLs, log levels, or YAML parsing with regex?

You said:
log = "Ping 192.168.1.1 successful, but 10.0.0.256 failed" ips = re.findall(r'\\b(?:\\d{1,3}\\.){3}\\d{1,3}\\b', log)

explan
ChatGPT said:
Let's break down the regular expression used to extract IP addresses:

re.findall(r'\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b', log)
This pattern is used to match IPv4 addresses like 192.168.1.1.

🔍 Full Explanation
Part	Meaning
\b	Word boundary – ensures we start matching from a full word (so it doesn’t match inside other text)
(?:...)	A non-capturing group – groups multiple expressions together without capturing them for .group()
\d{1,3}	Matches 1 to 3 digits (i.e., 0–999)
\.	A literal dot . (escaped because . means “any character” in regex)
(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}	Repeats number. exactly 3 times – for the first 3 octets
\d{1,3}	Matches the last part of the IP (after the last dot)
\b	Word boundary again to make sure the match ends cleanly
📌 Matches:
✅ 192.168.1.1

✅ 10.0.0.256 (though technically invalid, regex doesn't enforce <=255)

❌ What It Does Not Validate:
This regex does not validate whether the digits are in the valid IP range (0–255). So even though 999.999.999.999 is not a real IP, this regex would match it.

To validate real IPs, you need extra logic or a stricter regex like:

r'\b(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|1\d\d|[1-9]?\d)\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|1\d\d|[1-9]?\d)\b'
But for most simple IP extraction, the original regex works fine.

Would you like a version that also extracts port numbers or IPv6 addresses?

write py script to merge 2 dict combining values for keys that appear in both dicts
ChatGPT said:
Sure! Here's a Python script to merge two dictionaries where values for common keys are combined (e.g., added if numbers, concatenated if lists):

✅ Basic Version (assuming values are integers):
# Two dictionaries
dict1 = {'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'c': 30}
dict2 = {'b': 5, 'c': 15, 'd': 25}

# Merging with value combination
merged = {}

for key in set(dict1) | set(dict2):  # union of keys
    merged[key] = dict1.get(key, 0) + dict2.get(key, 0)

print(merged)
🟢 Output:
{'a': 10, 'b': 25, 'c': 45, 'd': 25}
✅ Advanced Version (if values are lists):
dict1 = {'a': [1, 2], 'b': [3], 'c': [4]}
dict2 = {'b': [5], 'c': [6, 7], 'd': [8]}

merged = {}

for key in set(dict1) | set(dict2):
    merged[key] = dict1.get(key, []) + dict2.get(key, [])

print(merged)
🧠 Tips:
Use dict.get(key, default) to avoid KeyError.

For custom value types (like sets, strings, dicts), you'll need to define specific merge logic.

Let me know the type of values you're dealing with (ints, lists, sets, etc.) and I’ll tailor it!

# RRead a csv file and finds out the average of a column values
ChatGPT said:
Here's a simple Python script using pandas to read a CSV file and calculate the average of a column (e.g., marks, price, etc.):

✅ Example Code:
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')  # Replace with your file name

# Display the first few rows (optional)
print(df.head())

# Calculate the average of a column (e.g., 'marks')
average = df['marks'].mean()

print("Average marks:", average)
📝 Notes:
Ensure your CSV file (e.g., data.csv) has a header row with the column name 'marks'.

You can change 'marks' to any column name you want to average (like 'price', 'age', etc.).

mean() automatically ignores missing (NaN) values.

📁 Sample data.csv:
name,marks
Alice,85
Bob,90
Charlie,78
David,88
Output:

Average marks: 85.25
Would you like a version that works without pandas (pure Python with csv module)?

scrappy python
ChatGPT said:
If you meant Scrapy — the Python framework for web scraping — here’s a quick introduction and example using Scrapy.

🕸️ What is Scrapy?
Scrapy is a powerful and fast web crawling and scraping framework written in Python. It's used to extract data from websites and process it as structured data (like JSON, CSV, etc.).

✅ Install Scrapy
pip install scrapy
🧪 Simple Scrapy Project Example
Let’s scrape quotes from http://quotes.toscrape.com, a test site for scraping.

1. Create a Scrapy Project
scrapy startproject quotes_scraper
cd quotes_scraper
2. Create a Spider
Create the file: quotes_scraper/spiders/quotes_spider.py

import scrapy

class QuotesSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "quotes"
    start_urls = ['http://quotes.toscrape.com']

    def parse(self, response):
        for quote in response.css('div.quote'):
            yield {
                'text': quote.css('span.text::text').get(),
                'author': quote.css('small.author::text').get(),
                'tags': quote.css('div.tags a.tag::text').getall(),
            }

        # Follow pagination
        next_page = response.css('li.next a::attr(href)').get()
        if next_page:
            yield response.follow(next_page, self.parse)
3. Run the Spider
scrapy crawl quotes -o quotes.json
This will save all scraped quotes into quotes.json.

📚 Key Concepts
Concept	Description
Spider	Class that defines how to follow links and extract data
start_urls	Initial URLs to start scraping
parse()	The main method Scrapy calls to process each page
yield	Used to emit scraped data or follow a new URL
Do you want to scrape real-world data like job listings, product prices, or news headlines? I can help write custom spiders for them.
