Great! Let's break down the PowerShell Scripting syllabus into structured, easy-to-digest parts. I'll guide you through each topic with explanations, examples, and small exercises. You can ask for more examples or dive deeper anytime.

🧠 1. What is Windows PowerShell?
PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language built on .NET. It's designed for system administration and automating tasks.

Combines the power of Unix-like shells with scripting capabilities.

Works with cmdlets – small .NET-based commands.

Example:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-Process
🏛️ 2. Windows PowerShell Architecture
PowerShell has four key components:

Hosting Layer – Runs in consoles, ISE, Visual Studio Code, etc.

Engine – Handles parsing, pipeline processing, execution.

Cmdlets & Providers – Interact with data sources like file systems, registry.

.NET Runtime – Executes the compiled code.

🔧 3. Understanding the Commands
Cmdlets are in Verb-Noun format.

You can use Get-Command to list available commands.

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-Command
🧾 4. Identifying the Parameters
Use Get-Help to learn about command parameters.

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-Help Get-Process -Full
Try tab-completion to explore parameters:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-Service -Name <TAB>
🔗 5. Working with the Pipeline
The pipeline (|) passes output from one command to another.

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.CPU -gt 10}
📤 6. Exporting, Importing, and Converting Data
Export to CSV/JSON/XML:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-Process | Export-Csv process.csv
Import:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Import-Csv process.csv
Convert:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-Service | ConvertTo-Json
🚿 7. Filtering Objects Out of the Pipeline
Use Where-Object and Select-Object.

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.WorkingSet -gt 50000000 } | Select-Object Name, ID
🎨 8. Formatting Output
powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-Process | Format-Table Name, ID, CPU
Get-Service | Format-List
📁 9. Redirecting Formatted Output
powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-Process | Out-File "processes.txt"
Get-Process | Out-Printer
📦 10. Creating Your Own Module
Create a .psm1 file:

powershell
Copy
Edit
function Hello-User { param($Name) "Hello $Name" }
Save as MyModule.psm1

Use:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Import-Module .\MyModule.psm1
Hello-User -Name "Alex"
✍️ 11. Preparing for Scripting
Use .ps1 file for scripts.

Start with:

powershell
Copy
Edit
# MyScript.ps1
Write-Output "Script Started"
🧮 12. Types of Variables
powershell
Copy
Edit
$int = 42
$string = "Hello"
$array = @(1, 2, 3)
$hashtable = @{Name="Alex"; Age=30}
🗃️ 13. Using Variables
powershell
Copy
Edit
$name = "Alex"
Write-Output "Welcome $name"
🌍 14. Scope of Variables
Global, Local, Script, Private

powershell
Copy
Edit
$global:name = "GlobalName"
🔒 15. Scripting Security
Check policy:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-ExecutionPolicy
Set it (as admin):

powershell
Copy
Edit
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
🌐 16. What is PowerShell Remoting?
Run commands on remote systems.

powershell
Copy
Edit
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName Server01
Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server01 -ScriptBlock { Get-Process }
🔁 17. Loops Supported in PowerShell
for, foreach, while, do-while

Example:

powershell
Copy
Edit
for ($i=1; $i -le 5; $i++) { Write-Output "Count $i" }
🔧 18. Understanding PowerShell Functions
powershell
Copy
Edit
function Get-Greeting {
    param($name)
    "Hello, $name!"
}
📄 19. Creating Profile Scripts
Location:

powershell
Copy
Edit
$PROFILE
Add custom aliases/functions:

powershell
Copy
Edit
function Start-Work { cd C:\Projects; code . }
